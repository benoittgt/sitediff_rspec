# RSpec yard doc diff

This PR is the result of Jon proposal on https://github.com/rspec/rspec.github.io/pull/131

We need to compare two versions of RSpec documentation generated by yard.

### Use the project

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/benoittgt/sitediff_rspec
$ cd sitediff_rspec 
# I use Ruby 2.7
$ ruby nokorigi-diff.rb
```

#### CLI args

Check args available to different verbose mode with `--help`. You can also run the diff on one url
in particular

### Elements in yard doc altered

* Remove the `.summary_signatures` and `.signature` class that are different between yard version. 
  ![](screen_captures/summary_signatures.png)
* Remove `Assertions-constant` block because yard doc now put them in a difference place.
  ![](screen_captures/Assertions-constant.png)
* Remove `collapse` buttons because old one include `( )`
  ![](screen_captures/collapse.png)
* Add ending dot when missing.
  ![](screen_captures/ending-dot.png)
* Don't diff new object links in source code
  ![](screen_captures/object-link.png)

The diff output still display few artifacts but most of the time they can be ignored.
