itself to receive. To register a formatter call:.This class isn't loaded at runtime but serves to document all of the

  Parameters:

    This method is invoked before any examples are run, right after
they have all been collected. This can be useful for special
formatters that need to provide progress on feedback (graphical ones).

This will only be invoked once, and the next one to be invoked
is #example_group_started.


  


  Parameters:

  
    
      
        notification
      
      
        (Notifications::StartNotification)
      
      
      
    
  




  
    
      



    
    
      # File 'lib/rspec/core/formatters/protocol.rb', line 25


    
  


    
      
  
  
    This method is invoked after all of the examples have executed. The
next method to be invoked after this one is #dump_failures
(BaseTextFormatter then calls #dump_failures once for each failed
example).


  


  Parameters:

  
    
      
        notification
      
      
        (Notifications::NullNotification)

    Invoked after all examples have executed, before dumping post-run
reports.


  


  Parameters:

  
    
      
        notification
      
      
        (Notifications::NullNotification)

    Defined in:
    lib/rspec/core/formatters/protocol.rb
  
  


Overview
  
    This class isn't loaded at runtime but serves to document all of the
notifications implemented as part of the standard interface. The
reporter will issue these during a normal test suite run, but a
formatter will only receive those notifications it has registered
itself to receive. To register a formatter call:.

::RSpec::Core::Formatters.register class, :list, :of, :notifications.

e.g.

::RSpec::Core::Formatters.register self, :start, :example_started.
