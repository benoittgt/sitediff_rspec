OverviewOverview
  
    An implementation of rspec-mocks' reference interface.
Used when a string is passed to ExampleMethods#object_double,
and when a string, named class or named module is passed to
ExampleMethods#instance_double, or ExampleMethods#class_double.
Represents a reference to the object named (via a constant lookup)
by the string.An implementation of rspec-mocks' reference interface.

Overview
  
    An implementation of rspec-mocks' reference interface.
Used when a string is passed to ExampleMethods#object_double,
and when a string, named class or named module is passed to
ExampleMethods#instance_double, or ExampleMethods#class_double.
Represents a reference to the object named (via a constant lookup)
by the string.
